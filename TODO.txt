1. Bell mod needs two sound files
2. Compress all textures, 3d objects, etc.

5. Complete the documentation
6. Rip out SmartFS and replace with I3, then update I3 to include the documentation
7. Document default mtg stuff

    a. Bosses/Mobs: 
        -KingSlime-https://www.blendswap.com/blend/26517
        -Bosses are basically already done, just use dmobs, living nether, etc to generate them
        - All boss and mobs documentation should be done at once, mods include:
            - dmobs
            - mobs_redo
            - living nether
            - mobs_water
            - seeker
            - nyan cat should be removed...
        - Boss drops need to be improved or changed to allow cool/better equipment or tools
