a. Bosses/Mobs: 
    -KingSlime-https://www.blendswap.com/blend/26517
    -Bosses are basically already done, just use dmobs, living nether, etc to generate them
        - Requires reworking the mob spawn locations
        - Mob drops must be adjusted to include their "special item" and some lore on
          how to find the next "boss" in order
    - All boss and mobs documentation should be done at once, mods include:
        - dmobs
        - mobs_redo
        - living nether
        - mobs_water
        - seeker
        - nyan cat should be removed...
b. Bosses in some order:
    1. Treeman
        a. Found in deep jungle, a specific biome within jungles
    2. Golem
        a. Found in deserts, specific area
    3. Ogre
        a. Found in caverns, maybe near a certain ore
    4. Orc "king" with orc buddies
        a. Should appear in Savanna possibly
    5. Wyvern/Dragons
        b. Floatlands?
