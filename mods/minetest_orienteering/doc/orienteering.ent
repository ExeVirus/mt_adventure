Orienteering
-----------------
This mod adds several tools which mostly aid in orientation. When carrying them,
this will enhance the HUD by adding several interesting information such as the
coordinates or the viewing angles or enabling the use of the minimap.


Orienteering tools
-------------------
The orienteering tools are used automatically. To use them, you only need to
have them somewhere in your hotbar. Most tools add information at the top
section of your screen. The minimap is disabled by default, in this mod
you have to acquire the proper tool first.

The following tools are available:

* Altimeter: Shows height (Y)
* Triangulator: Shows X and Z coordinates
* Compass: Shows yaw (horizontal angle)
* Sextant: Shows pitch (vertical angle)
* Watch: Shows the time (hours and minutes)
* Speedometer: Shows speed in m/s (1 m = side length of a single cube)
* Map: Enables usage of the minimap (only surface mode)
* Radar Mapper: Enables the usage of the minimap (surface and radar mode)
* GPS device: Shows X, Y, Z coordinates, yaw and time
* Quadcorder: Combination of everything above: Shows X, Y, Z coordinates, pitch,
  yaw, time, speed and enables minimap/radar

Note: The map will only be available if the game does not include the “map” mod
(found in Minetest Game), which already includes a mapping kit item.

To toggle between 12h and 24h mode for the displayed time, wield any device
which is capable of displaying the time and press the left mouse button.
