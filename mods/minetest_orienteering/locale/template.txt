# Help texts
It shows you your yaw (horizontal viewing angle) in degrees.=
It shows you your pitch (vertical viewing angle) in degrees.=
It shows you your current elevation (Y).=
It shows you the coordinates of your current position in the horizontal plane (X and Z).=
The GPS device shows you your coordinates (X, Y and Z), your yaw (horizontal viewing angle) and the time.=
It shows you your current horizontal (“hor.”) and vertical (“ver.”) speed in meters per second, where one meter is the side length of a single cube.=
It shows you the current time.=
This is the ultimate orientieering tool. It shows you your coordinates (X, Y and Z), shows your yaw and pitch (horizontal and vertical viewing angles), the current time, your current speed and it enables you to access the minimap.=
Binoculars allow you to zoom.=

Put this tool in your hotbar to see the data it provides.=
Put the watch in your hotbar to see the time. Punch to toggle between the 24-hour and 12-hour display.=
Put this tool in your hotbar to make use of its functionality. Punch to toggle between 24-hour and 12-hour display for the time feature.=

The radar mapper is a device that combines a map with a radar. It unlocks both the surface mode and radar mode of the minimap.=
If you put a radar mapper in your hotbar, you will be able to access the minimap. Press the “minimap” key to view the minimap.=
The map allows you to view a minimap of the area around you.=
If you put a map in your hotbar, you will be able to access the minimap (only surface mode). Press the “minimap” key to view the minimap.=
