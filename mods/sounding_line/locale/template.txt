A spool of marked line with a weight on the end used for measuring depths.=

Build this item over the location whose depths you wish to plumb. Right click on it to take a reading. The sounding line will give a reading indicating how far down the sounding line encountered water (if any) and how far down the first solid obstruction is.@n@nIf lava is encountered this will be indicated by a burnt end on the line. Sounding lines can't measure the depth of lava, only how far it is to the lava's surface.@n@nIf the sounding line reports encountering an "unknown void" it has reached a region that has not yet been generated by map generation.=
