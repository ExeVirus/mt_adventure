Farming
-----------------
Farming is the best way to feed yourself and your pets!
|
There are many different plants to be grown from corn
to strawberries to garlic.
|
Most all plants require water, soil, and sunlight. Soil
comes from using a hoe on dirt (left click), the water 
needs to touch that soil to make the soil wet, and then
you plant your seed (corn is it's own seed, for example)
in that soil (right click). Wait a bit and you will see
your plant starting to grow!
|
Each plant has different stages of growth to maturity and 
spawn in different biomes. Please refer to each plant's page
to learn more.
|
You can make artificial light with super_glow glass, 
and check the light on a specific spot with <f5> and
checking the light value. 
|
You can also make plants grow instantly with mulch, fertilizer,
etc.
|
Finally, you can flood all plants using water, which will essentially
harvest them instantly. A fun hack included in this game :)
