Detector
-----------------
There are two kinds of detectors: Node and Object.

Node Detector
==============
The node detector is a receptor. 
It changes its state when either any node or a specific node is detected. 
Right-click it to set a nodename to scan for. It can also receive digiline signals. 
For example, you can send {distance=4, scanname="default:dirt"} to set 
distance to 4 and scan for dirt. You can omit either parameter. 
There is also a command parameter: 
{command="get"} will respond with the detected nodename
{command="scan"} will respond with a boolean using the distance and nodename of the detector.
Nodenames must include the mod they reside in, so for instance default:dirt, not just dirt.
The distance parameter specifies how many blocks are between the node detector and the node
to detect. Automatic scanning with Mesecons output only works when the detector
is in an active block, but Digilines queries always work.

Object Detector
==============
The object detector is a receptor. It changes its state when a player approaches.
Right-click it to set a name to scan for. You can also search for comma-separated
lists of players where the detector gets activated if any of the names in the list are found.
It can also receive digiline signals which are the name to scan for on the specified channel 
in the right-click menu. Automatic scanning with Mesecons output only works when the detector
is in an active block, but Digilines queries always work.
