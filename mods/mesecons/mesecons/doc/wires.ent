Wires
-----------------
Mesecons are the wires, use them to connect effectors with receptors.
Wiring works through unloaded blocks; theyâ€™re loaded when the signal level changes.

Basic wire will essentially connect in all directions.
If you want to only have the wire connect in directions you specify,
then you should use insulated wire. To change the connections, you can rotate them
with a screwdriver (like almost everything else in the game)
