LuaController
-----------------
The Luacontroller is an advanced programmable component.
You can simply code it in the language Mesecons uses itself: 
    Lua! 

All the code runs in a sandbox, so it's completely safe 
(but I won't guarantee that for absolute certainty!). 
It works fine in an unloaded block, 
loading the block when the program needs to run. 

Events are properly delivered after a server restart.

Short programming reference:
----------------------------
ports = get_real_port_states(pos): gets if inputs are powered from outside
newport = merge_port_states(state1, state2): just does result = state1 or state2 for every port
set_port(pos, rule, state): activates/deactivates the mesecons according to the port states
set_port_states(pos, ports): Applies new port states to a Luacontroller at pos
run_inner(pos, code, event): runs code on the controller at pos and event
reset_formspec(pos, code, errmsg): installs new code and prints error messages, without resetting LCID
reset_meta(pos, code, errmsg): performs a software-reset, installs new code and prints error message
run(pos, event): a wrapper for run_inner which gets code & handles errors via reset_meta
resetn(pos): performs a hardware reset, turns off all ports
