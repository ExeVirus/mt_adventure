Sticky Blocks
-----------------
Sticky blocks can be used together with pistons 
or movestones to push / pull Structures that are 
"glued" together using sticky blocks.

These only respond to movestone or piston actions, and 
are not affected or create mesecon signals.

Remember the 20 block rule often still applies to pistons.
