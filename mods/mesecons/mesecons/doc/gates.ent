Logic Gates
-----------------
There are 7 different gates in mesecons, each do a 
logic operation to the signal(s) received. 

They all work in unloaded blocks.

AND
------
AND gates power their output if both inputs 
(from left and right) are powered.


Diode
-----
Diodes conduct signals in one direction only.

NAND
-----
NAND gates do not power their output if both inputs 
(from left and right) are powered, 
but power it in every other case.

NOR
-----
NOR gates only power their output if none of their two 
inputs is powered. They are basically OR gates with a 
NOT gate at their output.

NOT
----
NOT gates invert signals, just like a mesecon torch does, 
but faster. The input is at the opposite side of the output.

OR
-----
OR gates power their output if either of their inputs 
(or both) are powered. You could basically get the same 
behaviour with two diodes, but OR gates save some space.

XOR
-----
XOR gates power their output if only one input is powered, 
they're off if either both or none of the inputs is powered.
