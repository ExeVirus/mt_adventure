FPGAs (and Programmers)
-----------------
FPGA stands for "Field Programmable Gate Array"
Long story short, in the real world, these are 
essentially programable circuits. Here they function
similarly. 

From the Mesecon source:
++++++++++++
FPGAs can be used to chain multiple logic gates together in a compact manner. 
They come with 4 I/O ports and 10 internal registers, which can then be connected 
with each other to form logic circuits. 
They work fine in unloaded blocks.
Supported gate types: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, XNOR, Buffer (=)
I/O ports: A B C D; Registers: numbered 0 to 9
++++++++++++

To understand what this means requires some decent learning of real electrical circuits 
and logic. Feel free to paruse the Mesecons wiki and try some of the advanced tutorials,
they'll teach you some of these basics. 


Programmers:
-----------------
The FPGA programmer can be used to copy gate configurations from one FPGA to another.
[Shift]+[Right-Click] an FPGA to read its configuration and "remember" it. Left-click (punch) FPGAs to write the saved configuration to them.
