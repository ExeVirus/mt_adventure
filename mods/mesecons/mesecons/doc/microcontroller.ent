Microcontroller
-----------------
Not great documentation avaiable, 
but a single microcontroller allows four inputs:

A,B,C,D

And you apply standard binary operations on them:

XOR, NOT, AND, etc.

You can for example make B always the opposite of A:

sbi(B, !A)
"do(Output B 'equals' NOT A)"

sbi() is the syntax for Do() in this case,
and you can do multiple sbi()s in a single microcontroller:

sbi(B,!A)sbi(D,!C)

The above will make B opposite of A and D opposite of component.
And so on, just don't mix inputs and outputs, I'm sure that'll make for
some great bugs....
