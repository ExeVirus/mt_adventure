Remove Stone
-----------------
Removestones are probably the simplest effectors possible. 
They simply disappear when powered. 
They work in inactive blocks. 

Ghost Stone
-----------------
Ghoststones disappear when powered, just like Removestones.
But in contrast to Removestones, they reappear again when 
not powered anymore and they are also conductive.
They work in inactive blocks.
