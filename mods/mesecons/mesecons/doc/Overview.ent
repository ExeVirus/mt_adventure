What is Mesecons?

Machines, Switches, Electronics, Sounds, Programs!

Mesecones puts the world at your control, moving objects,
opening doors, detecting monsters, making computers, etc.

The documentation elsewhere here in-game just coveres specific items.
For understanding how to put them together, I reccomend the 
link above and go from there, this is not the end-all technical 
mod for minetest, and is included in this adventure-like game
to spice up your world as you see fit. This is not a nuclear power
plant or anything, feel free to add mods like techage, techpack,
digilines, technic, you get the idea:)
