Bell that rings every hour as many times as the hour counts (1-12 times)
Works like a church bell.

The positions of placed bells are saved. Thus, each bell can ring independently of the load status of the area the bell is in.

You can ring a bell manually.

There is also a small bell (looks like the normal one) that can be crafted from gold blocks. Unlike the normal bell, this craftable one won't ring automaticly and has a much smaller hear distance.

If you actually want to use this mod, you need to create a folder sounds/ in it (on the same level as textures/) and put sound files named bell_bell.ogg (for the large, uncraftable bell) and bell_small.ogg (for the craftable one) into the folder.
