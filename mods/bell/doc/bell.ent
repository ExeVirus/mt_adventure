Bell
-----------------
Bell that rings every hour as many times as the hour counts (1-12 times)
Like a church bell or townhall bell
-----------------
The positions of placed bells are saved.
Thus, each bell can ring even if the area is unloaded.
-----------------
You can ring a bell manually.
-----------------
There is also a small bell (looks like the normal one)
that can be crafted from gold blocks.
Unlike the normal bell, this craftable one won't
ring automaticly and has a much smaller hear distance.
