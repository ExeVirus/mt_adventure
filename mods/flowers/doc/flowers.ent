Flowers
-----------------
Flowers are decorations found throughout the world, typically in 
grassy biomes. They can be used for making dyes, and for other useful
recipes. 

Flora will naturally spread to fill available nearby soil, but only if there are not too many 
plants in the area already. This limit is roughly 7 flora per 9x9 area. Normal flowers need 13 light
to grow, and take a while to trigger (sometimes a full game-day). This makes them hard but not impossible
to farm and propogate.

The following is the list of the different plants and where they are found:
