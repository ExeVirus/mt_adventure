Moreblocks
-----------------
Moreblocks adds a lot of new decorative blocks
such as cactus brick, checker stone, clean glass, etc.

But most importantly it adds a circular saw!

The circular saw will let you cut a lot of different (not all)
kinds of nodes into various NOT blocky shapes, 
like triangles and slopes and small micro-blocks and plates. 

Super useful for making the perfect look to your builds!

Have fun and experiement! 
(also you can use them with bycycle to make ramps)
