Replacer
-----------------
This tool is helpful for creative purposes (i.e. build a wall and "paint" windows into it).
It replaces nodes with a previously selected other type of node (i.e. places said windows
into a brick wall).

Usage: Right-click on a node of that type you want to replace other nodes with.
       Left-click (normal usage) on any nodes you want to replace with the type you previously right-clicked on.
       SHIFT-Right-click in order to store a new pattern.

When in creative mode, the node will just be replaced. Your inventory will not be changed.

When not in creative mode, digging will be simulated and you will get what was there. In return, the replacement node
will be taken from your inventory.

===========================
This is the most useful creative/building tool in the game.
Use it with moreblocks circular saw pieces to speed up your
builds significantly and avoid using the screwdriver so much.
