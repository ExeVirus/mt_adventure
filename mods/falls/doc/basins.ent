Basins
-----------------
Basins are meant to be used at the base of a waterfall.
Place them beneath the water's surface, and particles
will "bounce" up as if they hit rocks in the water.

To change the height, distance, amount, and direction
of the particles, right-click the block to bring up 
a formspec to edit these values.
