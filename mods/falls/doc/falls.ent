Falls
-----------------
This mod adds a new machine: The "whirlpool machine", which 
you place a bucket of water in with a mese fragment,
and pull the lever. You will receive a bucket of "turbulent water"
|
Turbulent water is used to build new particle based fountains, waterfall
basins and waterfall blocks. Build a few and try building your very own 
waterfall, the results are amazing!
|
Hint: try using lava too.
