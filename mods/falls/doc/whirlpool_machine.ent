Whirlpool Machine
-----------------
The whirlpool machine is the fundamental piece
of the waterfalls mod. You place a bucket of waterfalls
in the top slot (or lava), and then use a mese fragment
in the bottom slot to power the machine.

Once filled, pull the lever to turn on the machine.

After the process completes, you will receive a turbulent
water bucket, used to craft the other falls blocks.
