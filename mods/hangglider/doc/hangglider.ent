Hang Glider
-----------------
Hang Gliders are some of the funnest tools in the game!
You hold it in hand, and after jumping left click to begin
flying. It does wear out, so keep that in mind:)

Note: protected areas can have "flak" set to on, which will shoot
you out of the sky over that players protected area! So don't get
too crazy out there...

To turn on flak, use: /area_flak [id] 
id = area ID.
