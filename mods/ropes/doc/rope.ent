Ropes
-----------------
Rope segments are bundles of fibre twisted into robust cables.
This craft item is useful for creating rope ladders, 
or for spooling on wooden spindles to hang and climb upon.


Rope ladders
-----------------
After a rope ladder is placed on a vertical wall it 
will begin extending downward until it reaches its maximum 
length. If the rope ladder is removed all of 
the ladder below the point of removal will disappear. 
A rope ladder can be severed partway down using an axe 
or similar tool, and the ladder below the point where 
it is cut will collapse. No rope is actually lost in 
the process, though, and if the uppermost section of the 
ladder is removed and replaced the ladder will re-extend 
to the same maximum length as before.

Rope boxes
-----------------
Rope boxes have a certain amount of rope contained within them specified 
in the name of the node, and have a limit to how much rope they can 
support that depends on the material they're made of. The different 
lengths can be crafted by combining and splitting up rope boxes in 
the crafting grid. For example, you can craft a 1m rope box by putting 
a 2m rope box and a rope segment in the crafting grid, or a 3m rope 
box and two rope segments in the crafting grid. Two rope segments can 
be recovered by putting the 4m rope box in the crafting grid by itself.


Extendable ladders
------------------
Right-clicking on a ladder with a stack of identical ladder items will automatically 
add new ladder segments to the top, provided it hasn't extended too far up beyond the 
last block behind it providing support.

Placing it against/on support nodes allows higher ladders.


Wooden bridge
-----------------
This behaves like most structural blocks except in one circumstance: 
when placed on top of a block with buildable space on the side facing away from you, 
this block will not be built on top but instead will extend out from that far side of 
the target block. This allows a platform to be easily built that juts out away from 
the location you're standing on. I.e. bridge over air easily.
