Algae
-----------------
The algae mod implements 3 different decorative algae mosses.
"Thin", "Medium", and "Thick"
These will appear in:
1. Forest biomes near the shore
2. Savana biomes near the shore
3. Rainforest Biomes near papyrus
-----------------
* They are purely decorative.
* When placed, they will be given a random rotation.
