Cartography-Tables
-----------------
There are three cartography tables, each providing more features than the last.
To make maps, you right click a table, and provide paper and black dye to the
"insert materials" tab. Once inserted, you can use the materials for making maps 
in the next tab. Maps can be upgraded, as well as copied. Higher detail maps and large zoom
maps need more materials to generate.

The (basic) table provides for basic maps, which are of low detail and washed coloring.
|
The standard table provides for Rank maps, which allow for different zoom levels and more coloration.
|
The Advanced table provides the most options for map making.
