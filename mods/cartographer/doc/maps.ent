Cartography-Maps
-----------------
To use a blank map, right click while it is selected.
Once used, a map will be tied to the area in which you right clicked.
I.e. maps are tied to a location, and you will need more than one to map the world.
|
Once opened, a map will display terrain you have already explored, as well as your 
current position, typically shown with a animated dark circle. 
|
You can toggle the height display option with the top right corner button
|
You can also place a single marker at your current location with the markers tab 
on the right. This marker will remain there for the next time you open the map, 
allowing you to create location guides, treasuremaps, detailed build plans,s etc.
