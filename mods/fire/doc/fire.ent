Fire
-----------------
Fire can be made with flint & steel, by 
right clicking on a flammable node.

Once ignited, fire will spread almost uncontrollably in all directions
until everything flammable in range is consumed.
What is more is that it grow in all directions from a flame,
so again be careful.

Coalblocks can have a permanent flame on top, it's a fun and dangerous
decoration. Use with caution.
