In-Game Commands
-----------------
Minetest chat is easily found by hitting the 't' button to
bring up the chat dialog. There you will see recent chat and other 
messages, and you can type your own. By default, if you have the "shout" 
priviledge (see Privilidges), you can send a chat message to everyone in the
server. If you want to use a name of a player in the server you can start typing 
the beginning and then hit {tab} to autocomplete. So for hte player 'Jackson' you only 
need to type "Jac" and hit {tab} to get: 'Jackson'

There are also in-game commands most players can execute, and these always start with
'/'. The command for respawning is '/killme' for example. Help can always be gotten with
99% of commands by typing 'help' which brings up a nice form for you to read through and 
understand. The list below are the built-in commands:

/killme             : kills you (takes armor typically) and respawns you at your spawnpoint
