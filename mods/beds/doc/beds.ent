Beds
-----------------
Beds allow players to skip the night by sleeping.
To sleep, right click on the bed. 
In singleplayer mode, the night gets skipped immediately.
If multiplayer mode, you see how many other players are in bed too,
if all players are sleeping the night gets skipped. 
The night skip can be forced if more than half of 
the players are lying in bed and use this option.
-----------------
Another feature is a controlled respawning. 
If you have slept in bed (not just lying in it)
your respawn point is set to the beds location
and you will respawn there after death.

They're bouncy too!
