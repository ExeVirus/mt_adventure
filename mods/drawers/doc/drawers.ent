Drawers
-----------------
This mod adds simple item storages showing the item's inventory image in the
front. By left- or right-clicking the image you can take or add stacks. If you
also hold the shift-key only a single item will be removed/added.
|
There's also a 'Drawer Controller' which can insert items automatically into a
network of drawers. Just place the drawers next to each other, so they are
connected and the drawer controller will sort the items automatically. If you
want to connect drawers, but you don't want to place another drawer, just use
the 'Drawer Trim'.

Do you have too many cobblestones for one drawer? No problem, just add some
drawer upgrades to your drawer! They are available in different sizes and are
crafted by steel, gold, obsidian, diamonds or mithril.
