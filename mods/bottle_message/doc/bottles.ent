Bottles (on water)
-----------------
They can also be found occasionally washed up on beaches containing a message.
|
You can also craft your own bottle, and write a message in it.
Right click (in the air) with a bottle, and paper in your inventory, then write your message.
|
Bottles can be placed on the ocean and will travel.
Place the bottle in the ocean, and it will roughly be carried by the tide in the direction it is facing.
The bottle will eventually wash up on land, where it can picked up, and read by right clicking (in the air).
|
A written bottle can be crafted back into paper and an empty bottle.
