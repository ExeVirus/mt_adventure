To all who find this: keep food handy, it's dangerous to travel on an emtpy stomach
I have done it! I have learned the secrets of travelnets...
Seeking great riches without first seeking knowledge is the road to ruin.
I have yet to tame my first horse, but I have tamed my first sea turtle.
I should have kept better track of my travels... where am I?
Night is coming, will I be ready?
Careful never impressed anyone.
