Travelnet
-----------------
Travelnets and Elevators are powerful tools for builders 
and adventurers alike. Build your own network of teleportors
and get where you want to be instantly!

Elevators only work in the y direction, and must be placed over each
other.

Travelnets can be placed anywhere and be on seperate networks (by player and name).

-------------------------------------------------
Usage:
- right-click on it; enter name of the station (e.g. "my house", "center of desert city") and name of the network (e.g. "intresting towns","my buildings")
- punch it to update the list of stations on that network
- right-click to use the travelbox

An unconfigured travelnet box can be configured by anyone. If it is misconfigured, just dig it and place it anew.
